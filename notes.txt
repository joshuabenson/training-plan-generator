how can I start to implement the first version of a feature that uses preferredDays? my idea is to keep the order of the workouts in the boilerplate the same, but for example if the preferred run days array are Tuesday Saturday Sunday then we take the running workouts from the play and remap them, in order, onto those days. Does that make sense from a traiing perspective and would my customers like that?
